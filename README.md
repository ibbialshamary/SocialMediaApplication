This is part of my final year project that I have picked.
Due to technical issues with the project and the technology used,
the early stages of development have been lost. I am choosing to use Node.js for
my server-side and Vue.js for my client-side. Socket.io will be used for the chat
implementation. I am trying to implement the Model View Controller architecture
so directory and file locations may frequently change. This is a project I will
be working on after my graduation, and many features are to be released soon.
