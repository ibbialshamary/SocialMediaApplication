Project Setup:
1. After cloning/downloading the project, make sure you are on the SocialMediaApplication main directory and type "npm install" in the terminal
2. Change the directory to the client package inside the SocialMediaApplication main directory by typing "cd client" and type "npm install" in the terminal
3. Change back to the main directory by typing "cd ../"
4. Run the project by typing "npm run dev" in the terminal
5. Access the website by entering the correct port used, normally localhost:8080

Due to technical issues with the project and the technology used, 
the early stages of development have been lost. I am choosing to use Node.js for
my server-side and Vue.js for my client-side. Socket.io will be used for the chat
implementation.
